TEST EVERYTHING! including glsl

bugs

- compile-time bounds checking should check for negative numbers, or use unsigned index?
- glsl nilify
- glsl static vars
- glsl verify no return
- glsl prevent calling in non-boomstick context
- enforce return in all code paths for procs with return type
- stack variable import uses wrong address
- assign empty compound literal, properly restricted compound literal

features

- generic structs
- variadics
- procs with capture
- map type
- ternary ? :
- string format procs (include console/file read/write) - strings.format, os.print, os.println
- compile-time execution
- OpenCL
- OpenGL rendering with bang kernels
- multi-assign
- multi-return
- windows
- mac

- cli
- debug
- docs

- const? by default for params? mutable?
- spread operator?
- default heap arena?
- byte pointers can be coerced to any other pointer type?
- default struct members? violates nil as default?
- nil coalesce? e.g. foo?.bar or foo ?? bar

stretch goals

- arm
- web
- android
- iOS

cleanup

- compiler performance
- print and check AST structure
- directives as nodes
- backend-specific errors instead of asserts, or "kernel" instead of "proc"?
- bounds checking in glsl? or disable in kernels? disable refs/pointers also
- negative tests (return errors from compile, fail if they are wrong messages, make for all error messages)
- check all TODOs
- verify/print glsl
- use unsigned ints where it makes more sense
- better type-checking for type-alias/link/import
- more descriptive parsing errors (contextual)
- better parsing/type-checking/more restrictive for compound literals
- disallow type redeclaration and require ":" for type aliases
- nilify for empty compound literals (single nilify per group of uninitialized members)
- switch only generate expression_node once
- switch require all enum values unless #partial
- align for stack vars (and other allocators?)
- test project in diff folder
- auto-convert dynamic array sizes
- dynamically sized soa
- check syscall as member proc...
- pointer to ranged-for element
- do not require casts for ranged fors e.g. 0..10
- make index available in ranged for
- prevent recursive struct
- restrict generic param types
- check if param names must match...
- set affinity of threads in thread pool (sched_setaffinity?)

- asm/glsl indenting etc.
- remove default return when not needed
- unify expression/assignment code, more efficient locations
- x86 asm review

- _ var not saved
- delete dynamic arrays/maps etc. in compiler after use
- removed _node from vars in compiler

- custom allocator for nodes in compiler?
- is coerce_type just upgrade and compare?
- switch slice range operator from : to ..?
- swap src/dest in copy?
- ref/deref procs?
- are atomic types necessary?
- lhs_expression/rhs_expression node types?
- switch to system-v calling convention?
- cint and cstring need to be explicitly imported? c.int and c.string?
- do not gen unreferenced vars? including static
