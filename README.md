# Coding Sessions Monorepo

This is a monorepo of all the code written during coding sessions recorded for [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZm1UOoSHv_A2JHpg24u6cQ).

NOTE: I am not currently accepting PRs for these projects. For continuity with the recordings it is easiest if all the code is written during the coding sessions.

## Series
